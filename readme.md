# Book of Go in Go

The goal of this project is to build a Go Book for estabilish double-eyes in corners and along edges.

## Use of igo
The game Go is sometimes called igo. In the programming language Go, there is a keyword go, so throwing a boardgame go into the mix wasn't a great idea. Instead, I just called it igo.
